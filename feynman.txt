Objects

Objects in JavaScript are associative arrays.  
Properties

Properties are the values of the key-value pairs that constitute the
associative arrays that objects are.

Methods

The values of an object that are functions are typically called methods.
Inside a method, the "this" keyword refers to the object to which the method
belongs.

for..in loop

The syntax `for (k in obj) { ... }` executes the block once for each key of
the given object.  You have a variable `k` that contains the key on each
iteration, and you can get the corresponding value as usual, using `obj[k]`.

dot notation vs bracket notation

In order that associative arrays in JavaScript should look more like objects,
you may use the obj.prop notation as equivalent to obj['prop'].  The dot
notation is generally preferred when the key is a constant; the bracket
notation is required otherwise.
